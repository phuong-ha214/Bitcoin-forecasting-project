# Bitcoin-forecasting-project
📌 Project Overview

This project builds a time-series forecasting system for Bitcoin daily log-returns using:

ARIMA (traditional statistical model)

XGBoost (tree-based ML model)

LSTM (deep learning sequence model)

Stacking meta-model (Ridge Regression)

The workflow produces out-of-sample predictions for each base model, evaluates performance, and combines them using stacking for improved accuracy.
